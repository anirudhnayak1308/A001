Fake News Detection - this projects used tf-idf techniques for detection of fake news in a given article, basically tfidfvectorizer is a statistical measure 
that tells how relevant a word is to that perticular document in a collection of document : how many times a word appears in a document, and the inverse document 
frequency of the word across a set of documents.

Passive Aggressive Classifiers :
Passive-Aggressive algorithms are generally used for large-scale learning. It is one of the few ‘online-learning algorithms‘. In online machine learning algorithms, 
the input data comes in sequential order and the machine learning model is updated step-by-step, as opposed to batch learning, where the entire training dataset 
is used at once.
